 Project Description: 
This code serves as a useful tool for users navigating the world of car dealerships. It simplifies the complex decision-making and process of purchasing a car and provides the customer with a simulation that will make the car-buying experience smoother and more enjoyable. It estimates car affordability, loan payments, and financial feasibility. It provides users with a list of cars, and based on their responses to a series of questions, the code will output the best car option for them. The recommendations take into account factors such as their credit score, payment method, and the specific car they are considering. 

Docker: 
During this project, we used Docker to build images and run the containers so that we could efficiently test, build, and run the code from different environments. 

Docker and Github Action: While constructing this project, we utilized Github Workflow (Simply Workflow) and InillejIdea to build and push an image to Docker. That way, we can pull the images from Docker and run them on our computers. 


JavaDocs: 

For this project, we utilized JavaDocs to make our code more comprehensible for users and to provide more documentation for our project in the future. We can also use JavaDocs to view and use comment tags, while all of the code that we push and commit to GitHub will be updated alongside it.
